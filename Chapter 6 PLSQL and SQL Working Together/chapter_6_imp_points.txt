Cursors are special PL/SQL objects that you define in the declaration section of a program.

declare
	cursor <c_name> is
	...
begin
	open <c_name>
	fetch <c_name> into <vars>
	close <c_name>
end;

Returning more than 1 variable - use record type, %ROWTYPE

Status info of cursor variables

%FOUND, %NOTFOUND, %ISOPEN, %ROWCOUNT

ORA-14551: cannot perform a DML operation inside a query.

For ex. f() - has an UPDATE

select f()
from dual;

will throw the ORA error, since it the state of the col isn't deterministic
